            <p>
                My name is Karabo Maria Bopape. 
                I am a final year computer science student at the University of the Witwatersrand. As a passionate software development individual, over the past few years I've gained proficiency 
                in multiple programming languages , which includes Java and C++. I strive to emrace all learning opportunities presented to me with a spirit of enthusiasm and try to leave an
                enduring positive impact in all activities I partake in.

                    Latest Project
                </h3>
                <p>
                The latest project that I have been working on is developing a website for a small bus service company
                that ensures ease of access and navigation for people who aren't proficient in technological literacy. The website is there to also eliminate the 3rd party
                bus ticket service provider that the company currently uses.
